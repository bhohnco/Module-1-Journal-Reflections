**Mod 2 Week 3: Job Search Strategies**

**Assess your habits from week 2:**
**how did you spend your time this past week?** 

>I spent it working on practice problems for our mid-mod assessment, working on our paired project, and spending some time with my family when I had some free time. Also worked out, did some painting, and also read a little. 

**What was effective in your habits?**

>Overall they were pretty effective. I was able to get up early each day to practice coding before class. The working out aspect has been helpful and made me more productive overall throughout the day. It has also helped me with sleep and being able to sleep through the night. Brought down my stress level. 

**What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?**

>Scheduling my time better and putting time blocks on my calendar for PD, and making time for myself. Being more mindful of things I need to do on top of my school work and project time. 

Reflect on how you’ve spent your time so far at Turing to gauge your engagement and energy:

**When have you been excited, focused, and enjoyed your work?**

>When tackling a new problem or working through an issue with a team member. Seeing progress and eventually finding the solution. Going through the struggle together. 

**When have you felt bored, restless, or unhappy?** 

>When I haven't taking a break from work or am stuck and keep trying to push through to find the answer. Leads to a burnt out feeling and that I'll never be able to solve the problem. Breaks help with that. 

**When do you feel energized in your work? When is your energy drained?**

>In the morning, and having some quiet alone time to work through an issue or problem. Being able to focus on the task. I feel drained late at night when I should stop coding and try again the next day. Knowing when to quit for the day and not push myself when I'm clearly not doing good work. 

**Setting up habits and routines to make time for the job search this module:**

**Block out time on your calendar this week to work on your job search.**


**When will you make this happen? How will you hold yourself accountable to this? What activities will you focus on during this time this week? What outcomes do you hope to reach by the end of this week because of these activities?**


**Applying wayfinding to using job search resources**
**Go through the resources listed here and explore 2-3 tools. List what you looked at here:**


**Apply wayfinding: of what you looked at, what did you discover that aligns with your vision? If it didn’t align with your vision, what will you try next? Decide what tools to bookmark to explore later.**


**Find a job posting that aligns with your vision. What’s the posting? How does it align with what you’re looking for? Add it to your Huntr.**


**What next steps will you take to explore that opportunity and find contacts? Add that information to your Huntr card.**


**Mod 2 Week 2: Professional Storytelling & Branding**

**Assess your habits from week 1: how did you spend your time this past week?**

>

**What was effective in your habits?**

>

**What could be more effective? What steps will you take to make that happen?**

>

**Write a draft of your professional story here as 1-2 paragraphs. Focus on answering the questions who are you, why are you here, and what’s next? Consider how to talk about your motives and values, the turning points that led to your career change, and what you envision for yourself going forward.**

>

**Update your LinkedIn profile with the following: updated photo/headshot, headline, summary statement using your story, and Turing added to your experience and education sections. Include a link to your profile here in the journal. Remember the guidelines and tips from the lesson here.**

>

**What other steps will you take this week to update your branding or practice your story?**

**Mod 2 Week 1: Building Habits to Become a Software Developer, Part II**

**Reflect on your habits from last module. What behaviors and activities were helpful for you? What activities and behaviors could be more effective for you?**

>Getting up early before class and practicing some coding, or looking at the lessons for the day. Trying to come to class with any questions I had regarding the lessons I looked over. Taking breaks when stuck and also making time to work out and release stress. 
>I think I can do a better job when it comes to reaching out for help and knowing when I hit my limit. Asking for help isn't a bad thing, and I need to do a better job of reframing that in my head. 

**What processes would you like to try differently this module to become more effective at your work and as a software developer?**

>Staying the course on pre-teaching and looking over anything we are going to cover beforehand. I find it help to have an idea of what we're going over and also it gives me time to take in the concepts at my own speed before turings speed takes back over. 

**Setting intentions for this module: who do I want to be this module? What specific habits would help me get there? How are those habits tied to the identity of a software developer?**

>I want to be successful with the lessons and new material, and also lean into the struggle a little more. Ask for help when I need it and not be afraid of judgement. I plan on reaching out more when I'm stuck or having a hard time with an issue or problem. I beleive those are tied to growth and the growth mindset. Also understanding that no one does it alone, so why should you try to force that thinking? Be open to help and welcome it. 

**Incorporate temptation bundling to create a new habit by using this template:**

**After [making coffee], I will [work out].
After [working out], I will [look over the lesson plan for the day].
How to enjoy “hard” habits: Reframe your habits to consider their benefits rather than their drawbacks; name 3 habits that you have to do and explain the benefits of them.**

>working out - it provides me more energy, less stess, and overall better happiness
>eating health - mantain a healthy body weight, have more energy, and don't feel as sluggest or tired
>reading - keeps my mind sharp, helps with writting and grammar, also helps me sleep at night by clearing my mind before bed. 

**How do they further your goals longterm?**

>by adding years to my life, holding myself accountable, and also having outlets for my mental health. 

**How will they add to your processes as a successful developer?**

>They will help me when I'm stressed at work or need to take a POM. They will help keep me balanced and also help keep confidence level up. They are things I can reach for when I need them or need to step away from it all. Leading me to come back in a better frame of mind and more cleared headed to address any work issues. 

**At the end of the day, how do they add to your life?**

>They keep me more blanced and present. Helping me to connect with loved ones and the moment. 

**Environment design (optional 5-min. additional reading: Motivation is Overvalued. Environment Often Matters More): how does your environment set-up currently help you with your habits? How could it be improved to make it easier for you to follow through on your habits?**

> I have an office dedicated to school and only school. I do not bring my work outside of my office so the rest of my home is for other parts of my life. I believe I could add a quiet meditation spot to my home to help me get away and destress. It's something I plan on doing in a few weeks. 

**“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” Read this 4-min article on how to stop procrastinating. Apply the 2-minute rule to reframe 2-3 of your habits by scaling them down into the 2-minute version. How does this reframing help you think about shaping your new identity as a software developer?**

>I need to read the article and come back to this question. 

**Mod 1 week 5**

**Habits Reflection:**

**How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been?**

>I've noticed when I stick with habits that are productive to my growth and learning, I'm more happy and easier to be around. I feel better overall and more confident. I've been implementing more exercise and time for myself. Making sure I take breaks and step away from work to catch my breathe. The results have been really good, and I plan on stick with them. 

**Design Thinking Reflection: Cultivating Beginner’s Mind**

**How can beginner’s mind be helpful when it comes to thinking about your career and job search? What are some habits you could put into place to cultivate beginner’s mind regularly?**

>Being more open to learning and trying new things. Having a mind set that you don't know everything, and thats okay. Understanding and being able to define what you do know and don't. I think putting in place time to read about new ideas and things to learn. Always try to grow and learn something new everyday, if possible. 

**Optional additional reading: How to Cultivate Beginner’s Mind to Become a True Expert**

**Go through the Flower Exercise brainstorming worksheets linked here. Then complete your Flower Exercise final worksheet here and link that finished worksheet here.**

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTogmUzjIurMJ5g3raQ2ISI7Ge2a3S5LvpGY-QqgQco/edit?usp=sharing

**Write out your top 5 strengths that you’ve seen in action this module; then write out the strengths of a software developer. Where do you see these lists overlapping? Where are they different?**

my strengths
> Problem solving
> Team working and team building 
> Learning mindset
> Determined 
> Perseverance 

software strengths
> Breaking things down into small steps
> Team work
> Mindset growth
> Problem solving 
> Determination 

They overlap in a few areas and are very similar. They are slightly different as I need to get better at breaking things down into small steps, and taking on bigger problems. 

**Write a refined vision statement here (what new things have you discovered this week to incorporate into your vision statement?):**

>I strive to grow, change, and adapt throughout my whole professional career with the mindset that you never stop learning. I intend to always have a >growth mindset, and be open to new things. I want to challenge myself to learn more from others, be open to new ideas, and think outside the box. I >will be confident in myself and my skills, and use that to adapt and pivot. I value nature and the outdoors, creating and designing new things, and >always looking for the silver lining in things. I want those ideals to transfer over into what I will do professionally. 


**Mod 1 Week 4: Creating Your Vision, Part I**

**Habits Reflection:**
**How have you seen yourself become more aware of your habits? Have you tried implementing anything new? What have the results been?**

>I've been noticing the habits I use that are beneficial to my growth, and have been trying to implement them every day. I have started to work out in the morning before I log on to school. It has been helpful with stress and overall management of work load. I'm working on getting into a rhythm with it all. 

**Start Where You Are (Empathize with the user -- you)
Health: how you answer “how are you”; intersection of physical, mental, and emotional health**

**How would you rate your overall health on a scale of 1-5? How do you currently make time for activities associated with your health? What is a small change you could make here to readjust your health ratings?**

>I'd currently rate it at a 3. I do make time to go for walks, workout, or ride my bike. I could start meditating or try other tasks to assist with my mental health and wellness. I need to work in that area in my regards to my health.

**Work: what you do**

**Make a short list of all the ways you work right now; How much value do each of those things bring to your life? How are those activities purposeful for you?**

>Study new lessons, practice new challenges, and trying new work/school related things. They all bring a different amount of value to my growth as a person and professional. They help me learn, challenge myself, and overall grow as a person. 

**Play: what brings you joy? Think about joy just for the pure sake of doing it; everyone benefits from this kind of play**

**What activities do you do that bring you joy throughout an average week? In what ways could you make a small change to bring more joy into your life?**

>Take my dog for a walk or throwing the ball for her. Playing an instrument or drawing. I could carve out time in my calendar to have dedicated time for things that bring me joy. Having it set on the calendar would make me more aware of taking the time out of my week to do that. 

**Love: sense of connection; who are the people who matter in your life and how is love flowing to and from you and them?**

> My partner, family, and friends. We talk, check in on each-other and make sure we're doing alright with everything going on. 

**How does love currently show up in your life? How do you show love to others right now? What adjustments would you like to make in this area?**

>It shows up in forms of caring and reaching out to check in on folks. Asking how people are doing and making time to listen. I would like to be present more and not thinking about school, futute projects, or being overall stressed. Making time to connect and compartmentalize my stress/tasks. 

**Looking back at the 4 areas, do any problems emerge that you want to begin designing solutions for?**

>Yes. I overall want to be better with stress management and my mental health. 

**Define your needs, problem, and insights:**

**Based on what you wrote about above and your group conversation, what problems have you identified that you'd like to design solutions for? What do you already about what you want for your career? What do you still need to find out? Who or what do you want to grow into by the end of the Turing program?**

>Stress management, information retention, and overall happiness. I would like to have a better idea about my path and how to get there. What things I should be doing now to set myself up for success in the future and as a developer. I still need to find my groove and pace. I want to be more conifdent in my skills and as a person as a whole. Knowing what I can and can't do. 

**Ideate -- challenge assumptions**

**When you discussed software developers with your small group on Monday, what assumptions came up about what software developers actually do? What steps could you take to challenge those assumptions and find more facts to answer the question of what developers do? In addition to what a typical software developer life could look like, what do you want yours to include?**

>The assumption that they know everyting about coding and how to do it successfully. I can talk to my mentor more about it and get an understanding of what they do day to day at their job. Get a better understanding of thier role and how it plays into the company they work for. I want mine to have a good work life balance and be able to have a life outside of work. 

**Prototype -- start creating solutions**

**What is the basic threshold that your new career must meet after Turing? What would you hope WILL NOT happen in your future after Turing? What is your absolute, no-holds-barred, ideal dream for your future after Turing?**

>I would like to use what I learned at Turing in the field and be able to implement them to grow as a professional. I hope I don't struggle for over a year to find a job and get more into debt. I would love to work as a developer for some time of event company or for live music. I would find that work interesting and fufilling.  

**Test –- solutions**

**Based on this week of reflections, write out your initial vision statement for your career:**

>I hope to be successful in where ever my career takes me. To be challenged and also feel fulfilled in what I'm doing. 

Week 3:

**Habits of a Software Developer**

**What do you think are the traits of a good software developer? What are they like in the workplace? What would you as a co-worker think of this person?**

>Someone who is constantly growing & looking for ways to improve. Self motivated. I think they're flexible & patience, & always willing to help. I would think that they are confident in who they are & what they can or can't do. 

**What are the habits that this person demonstrates to embody the identity of a software developer?**

>Pratice, pratice, pratice. Working through challenging problems and good at breaking things down piece by piece. 

**Who do you want to be as a software developer? What kind of behaviors do you already have in place to be that person? What behaviors would you need to put into place? How will you do that?**

>I would like to be similar to the person I described above. I'm confident in some areas of my life, but need to become more conifdent professionally. I need to >practice more and find time to work through areas I get stuck in. I plan on putting more time into my calendar for working on these areas.  

**Working on the 1st Law of Behavior Change: Make it Obvious**

**Bring self-awareness to your current habits by making a Habits Scorecard. Make a list of your daily habits (examples: wake up, turn off alarm, check phone, etc.) as a way to bring awareness to what you do. Then, decide how effective that habit is for you and your goal of becoming a software developer. Put a + next to habits that are effective; put a - next to habits that are not effective; put a = next to habits that are neutral.**

**Pick 1 new habit you’d like to build and create an implementation intention following this template: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” Then, stack the habit onto something you already do: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” (Hint: make this highly specific and immediately actionable)**

>After making coffee in the morning, I will start my morning workout. 

**Design your environment for success: what changes could you make in your space to better implement your habit? How could you remove any triggers for bad habits? How will you implement these changes?**

>I can wake up earlier and dedicate more time to my new postive habits. For bad habits, trying to element the option of them. For example, eating healther by not >buying junk food and purchasing more fruits and vegetables. Being smarter about what I'm putting in my body, and also how I'm burning off excess energy and >stress.

**Respond after a few days of this implementation: What are your results? How do you feel about this method? How will you move forward with this habit?**
>I found it helpful so far, but need to stay more consistant with it all. The results were mixed, as I only did it half of the days but its a start. I will keep trying to make it a routine and get into the groove of this habit being linked to my other morning habits and tasks. 

**Mod 1 Week 2: Building Your Compass**
**Answer the below questions in a separate gist and link them into your career journal using this template:**

Week 2: [Link here to your gist]

**Power of self-reflection**
**What is challenging about self-reflection?**
>Its hard to look into yourself and think about things you do well or need to work on. It's also hard to think about yourself objectively. 

**How can you continue to build the habit of self-reflection at Turing?**
>By using a journal and reflecting on things you're doing well, or need to work on. By practicing daily reflection and using it to grow. 

**Social identity mapping**

**First, create you own social identity map on a piece of paper (or print this out):**

**Outer ring: write words that describe your given identity
Middle ring: list aspects of your chosen identity
Center: write your core attributes—traits, behaviors, beliefs, values, characteristics, and skills that you think make you unique as an individual. Select things that are enduring and key to who you are.
After you complete your map:**

Underline the items that are important to you
Put a + beside the items that you believe clearly demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
Put a - beside the items that you believe do not demonstrate that you fit into the tech industry
Put a ? beside the items that you're unsure how they could show your ability to contribute to the tech industry
Reflect:

**What does your social identity tell you about what you already bring to the tech industry?**
>That I've had a diverse work background and understanding of different work cultures and areas. Also that listening and reflecting back is very important to me, and that I find it helpful in a professional setting. 

**What would it look like for some of your minuses or question marks to turn into pluses? In other words, how could some of these traits be assets for the tech industry?**
>I think some of my minuses could be worked on or adjusted through self reflection and hard work. I belevie I would need to make a plan of attack to address these things and make them more concrete professional skills. 

**Values mapping Pull out 5 values for each bullet below from this list:**
**Always valued:** >Hard work. 
**Often valued:** >Connection
**Sometimes valued:** >Success 
**Seldom valued:** >Laziness
**Reflect:** >Using the strengths I have to work on the strengths I lack. Growing myself professionally and being more well rounded. 

**What do these values tell you about yourself?**
>That I beleive hard work goes a long way in life, and having a strong value of that can blend into other aspects of your life and career.

**Workview & Lifeview**
**Summarize what good, worthwhile work means to you (Tip: this is NOT about what work you want to do but about why work matters to you)**:
>Worth while work to me looks like teamwork, connection, challenging work, and professional growth. 
**Lifeview: summarize what you value in life; what matters to you?**
>Family and friends, a successful marriage, connection, fufillment, and safety. 
**Where do your views on work and life complement each other?**
>I tend to have my professional work ethic blend into my life and living outside of work. I give it my all when approaching tasks outside of work, and try to approach it with a positive attitude. 
**Where do they clash?**
>With my time management and the ability to recognize the difference between the two. 
**Does one drive the other?**
>Currently my work life drives my life outside of work. 
**How?**
>It tends to take over any of my life outside of work. 



**Mod 1 Week 1: Understanding your strengths**

**Describe one of your strengths**

**What is something you have learned to do well (list a skill)?**
>I have learned to build a lot of things with my hands. DIY home projects, woodworking pieces, and general construction. 
**What is something you know about (list some knowledge/expertise you have)?**
>I know a lot about logistics, shipping patterns, and importation. 
**What is something you have a natural ability to do well (list a talent)?**
>I am artistic. I can draw and paint well.

**How could you combine these to describe a specific strength?**
>I believe I'm a fast learner and pick up on things fairly quickly. I like a challenge and I'm willing to put in the hard work to accomplish it. 

*Read through your Top 4 results from Pairin*

**In your own words, what do these top 4 qualities tell you about yourself?**
These qualities make me happy with the person I've become. I think these qualities are acurate with how I view and approach the world. Also, how I approach my professional life and career. I think I have a nice balance of all 4 qualities, and use them in the right way. 

**Do they resonate with you? Why/why not?**
They do resonate with me. I take pride in being imaginative and having a can do attitude. I think its helpful when approaching any challenge in life, and goes a long way when I feel stuck or unmotivated. I feel that I'm very authentic and truthful, and do not try to be someone I'm not. 

**How do they relate to the strength you wrote about in Prompt #1?**
They relate to me being artistic, picking up new tasks and hobbies quickly (woodworking,DIY) and having an optimistic modd and view on life. 
*Challenges with strengths*

**What can make it challenging to recognize your strengths? How can you work through those challenges?**
Feeling overwhelmed or feeling like you don't have many strengths. Feeling not confident in myself. 
Working through those feelings and recongnizing that they are real, but not the truth. Reminding myself that I'm capiable and a hard worker. 

**Do you ever see yourself overusing certain strengths? In what circumstances would you want to use them less and amplify other strengths? How could you adjust your approach in those instances?**
Yes. I see myself overworking sometimes and pushing myself when I need to take a break. Also, going into a new situation with too much confidence or not enough. I would want to use (overworking) it less during the learning process and give myself some room to grow and recharge. I'm starting to adjust my approach towards it durning coding work and turing in general. Reminding myself that breaks are good for my body and mind. Also, helps with stress management. 
*Strengths in action*

**Write 1-2 sentences describing how you like to work (i.e., Do you pre-plan? Do you talk through your ideas first? Do you work better with deadlines? How do you stay organized?)**
I like to see what work needs to be done, learn as much about the correct way to approach it, and then get my hands dirty working through the task at hand. I'm more of a hands on learner and do better with practice and learning from that practice. 
**How could you describe these working preferences to your project teammates? Your mentor? Your instructors?**
That I'm a visual/hands on learner that does better when I'm working through something and value the teamwork process in learning something together. 
**What would you need to be aware of when working with people who have different strengths from you?**
That not everyone has the same strengths as me and that most people will have different strengths. These can be hard to reconginize at first and determine, but I think working with people who have different strengths than yourself is a help way to grow and develop as a professional. 
**How could your Pairin results help you better understand your everyday working preferences?**
Reading more about the results and reflecting on what I recongnize to be true. Leaning more into learning about my strengths and how to best use them in a professional setting. Overall just learning more about myself so I can see where I need to improve. 
**Continued growth**

**Is there any particular strength you’d like to sharpen while you’re at Turing? Any area you consider a weakness that you’d like to strengthen?**
I'd like to sharpen my computer skills and general typing ability. Organizational skills and keeping better track of the things I need to do week by week. 
**What are some steps you could take here?**
Read more about ways I can sharpen both skills, and put the things I learn into practice. Track my progress week by week to see improvement or ways to increase these skills. Writing to do lists with actions that help with these skills. 
**How could you be aware of progress you’re making?**
Track and write down the small wins or setbacks. Learn from mistakes and also recongnize when I've made progress. But keep the progress up and stay with the process. Knowing that it will take time and not happen overnight. Not getting down on myself when I do not see change quick enough. Staying the course. 



Mod 0 career dev
1. **When you've worked towards a goal in the past, what systems or tools have been helpful for you in accomplishing that goal? How could you adapt those same systems/tools to use while at Turing?**
> I usually try to write steps and tasks that I need to take to get to that goal. Then little by little adjust those steps depending on how my progress is going. Write the steps and progress down, and then come back to it while you're working towards that goal. For example, I kept a note book of everything I did to find a job out in Colorado, and make the move here from Illinois. It took me close to three months to make it happen, and I believe keeping track of the progress and making notes on things that did work or didnt and adjust my plan according to my progress. I think having a few notebooks (career, notes, and school work) will help me with Turing and also help create the right structure for me to be successful with my upcoming journey. Also, reaching out and asking questions and requesting help will be beneficial to my learning progress. 
2. **As you start this new career, what is one of your strengths and how do you know?**
> I believe I'm very good at multitasking. I've been working in a position for the last 6 years where I need to use 4-5 different systems for orders, respond to daily emails, create daily reports, and work with people over teams to accomplish our goals. I think I'm well organized but I also believe I can do a better job with my organizational skills. 
3. **Describe how you work best (conditions, environment, preferences, etc.):**
> I work well in a quiet office location, with some light music (mostly soundtracks) playing to help me focus. I also work well in a team setting, and really enjoy team projects and group work. 
4. **As you start this new career, what is your greatest area of improvement when it comes to your professional skills?**
> Asking for help, and knowing when to ask help. Not letting myself get too far into the rabbit hole of doubt. 
How will developing a deeper understanding of your strengths and working preferences benefit you as a software developer? It will show me things I do well, and things I need to work on to be a better professional. I think there is always something you can be working on, and I'm excited to get my professional career a little more in tune. I know I have things I need to work on, and I also know it will be challenging to make those changes, but I'm up for the task and the work involved. I've grown in other aspects of my life and I'm excited to grow my professional skill set, and be more confident in that aspect of my life. 
5. **Describe the vision you currently have for your career after Turing:**
> I would love to work for technical company developing an application or working on a team of developers. I would love to have a position where I can have individual work, but also work in a team setting. I think I would thrive in that type of work environment.
